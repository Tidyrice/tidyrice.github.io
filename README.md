# tidyrice.github.io - Cheney's Personal Website
This is the first website I made. Throughout the experience, I will be developing HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills. I'm making this website as I believe it will better reflect my abilities as a programmer than a PDF resume for future employers. This is also a just-for-fun project :)

#Future goals
In the future I plan to develop more pages, such as ones dedicated to a resume and contacts.
